# Games that Teach Computer Science
A list of educational games that teach computer science concepts.

## Programming Concepts

### Free Games
[Screeps](https://screeps.com/) - An online game where JavaScript is used to program a colony of creatures. Scripts continue to run and creatures continue to exist when the player is offline, and they can interact with the colonies of other players.

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Introduces a game-like structure to a massive collection of programming challenges in just about any language you'd like to learn.

### Paid Games
[Human Resource Machine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/375820/Human_Resource_Machine/) - A game that teaches basic programming concepts by having the player use code to control office workers in a dystopian corporate world.

[7 Billion Humans](https://store.steampowered.com/app/792100/7_Billion_Humans/) - The sequel to Human Resource Machine. Builds upon concepts introduced in the first game and changes the mechanisms which the player uses to control the office workers.

## CSS

### Free Games
[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Teaches the user how to use CSS Flexbox by using Flexbox properties to place frogs on their lilypads.

[Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - A similar to Flexbox Froggy. Use Flexbox properties to line up all of hte zombies to be hit by your crossbow. Covers the same basics as Flexbox Froggy but goes much deeper.

[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - Just like Flexbox Froggy, but teaches CSS Grid.

## Machine Learning

### Paid Games
[While True: Learn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/) - Teaches the player some basic programming concepts

## Computer Architecture

### Paid Games
[Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) - A comprehensive view of computer architecture from basic logic gates and circuits to a Turing complete computer which you can program in Assembly. Features a sandbox mode where you can build whatever you'd like to your heart's content.

## Cloud Architecture

### Free Games
[AWS Quest](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/) - A 3D RPG that teaches the basics of the AWS cloud platform.

## Non Educational Games with Programming Elements
These games feature elements of programming, but computer science education is not the main goal. I think most of these can give you some programming insight, but your mileage may vary!

### Paid Games
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) - Minecraft's redstone system is Turing complete, and famously many players have built redstone computers. I think that the game titled ["Turing Complete"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) listed above is a much better educational tool, but Minecraft certainly does provide a valid way to learn circuits and logic gates.

[Final Fantasy XII](https://store.steampowered.com/app/595520/FINAL_FANTASY_XII_THE_ZODIAC_AGE/) - This game includes a system called "the Gambit System" which allows you to program your party members behavior in combat. As you progress, more and more code blocks can be purchased from merchants in the world, allowing increasingly complex behavior. This is probably the least educationally valuable example on this list, but it's really cool and does get you thinking about conditionals at least.

[Doom (2016](https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/) - The map editor in this game has an EXTREMELY complex scripting system that allows you to write actual programs for your levels.
